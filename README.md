## What is Web3 üåê??
Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet, transitioning from centralized control to decentralized ecosystems. Powered by blockchain technology, Web3 enables peer-to-peer interactions, ownership of digital assets, and transparent, trustless systems. It empowers users to control their data, participate in decentralized finance (DeFi), and interact with smart contracts, making the internet more open, secure, and user-driven.

### About Smart Contracts üìú
Smart contracts are self-executing agreements written in code that run on blockchain networks. They automatically enforce the terms and conditions set between parties without the need for intermediaries.
Key Features of Smart Contracts:
- **Decentralized Execution:** Operates on a blockchain, ensuring no single entity controls the process.
- **Transparency:** All terms and transactions are visible on the blockchain.
- **Automation:** Executes actions (like fund transfers) automatically when predefined conditions are met.
- **Security:** Immutable and tamper-proof, ensuring the integrity of agreements.

Smart contracts power a wide range of applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, digital identity, gaming, and crowdfunding platforms like Fund-Hive, enabling trustless and efficient systems.

## Setup Apps üåç

### **Anchor**

This is a Solana smart contract developed in Rust using the Anchor framework.

#### Commands

You can use standard Anchor commands. Either navigate to the `anchor` directory (`cd anchor`) and run the `anchor command` directly, or prefix the command with `pnpm`, e.g., `pnpm anchor`.

#### Sync the program id:

Running this command will generate a new keypair in the `anchor/target/deploy` directory, update the address in the Anchor configuration file, and modify the `declare_id!` macro in the program's `./src/lib.rs` file.

## Now Install Rust, Solana & Anchor CLI (WSL(Ubuntu) / Unix / Linux)
### Install Rust

Developers build Solana programs using the Rust programming language.
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
```
Run the following command to reload your PATH environment variable to include Cargo's bin directory:
```bash
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```
To verify the installation succeeded, check the Rust version:
```bash
rustc --version
```
You should see output like the following:
```shell
rustc 1.84.1 (e71f9a9a9 2025-01-27)
```

### Install Solana CLI
The Solana CLI provides all the tools required to build and deploy Solana programs.
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
```
For a first-time installation of the Solana CLI, you may see the following message prompting you to add a PATH environment variable
```bash
Close and reopen your terminal to apply the PATH changes or run the following in your existing shell:

export PATH="/Users/test/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

Now Reopen the Terminal after Seting Up the Path variables

```bash
echo $SHELL
```
- If the output contains /bash, use .bashrc.
- If the output contains /zsh, use .zshrc.

Depending on your shell, run the appropriate command.
- For Bash (bashrc):
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
- For Zsh (zshrc):
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then run the following command to refresh the terminal session or restart your terminal.
```bash
source ~/.bashrc # If using Bash
```
```bash
source ~/.zshrc # If using Zsh
```

To verify that the installation succeeded, check the Solana CLI version:
```bash
solana --version
```
You should see output like the following:
```shell
solana-cli 2.0.26 (src:3dccb3e7; feat:607245837, client:Agave)
```

Later update the Solana CLI to the latest version
```bash
agave-install update
```

### Install Anchor CLI
Anchor is a framework for developing Solana programs. The Anchor framework leverages Rust macros to simplify the process of writing Solana programs.
The Anchor version manager (AVM) allows you to install and manage different Anchor versions on your system and easily update Anchor versions in the future.
- Install AVM with the following command:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force
```
- Confirm that AVM installed successfully:
```bash
avm --version
```
- Install the latest version of Anchor CLI using AVM:
```bash
avm install latest
```
```bash
avm use latest
```
- You can install a specific version of Anchor CLI by specifying the version number:
```bash
avm install 0.30.1
avm use 0.30.1
```

To verify that the installation succeeded, check the Anchor CLI version:
```bash
anchor --version
```
You should see output like the following:
```shell
anchor-cli 0.30.1
```

> [!Warning]  
> When installing the Anchor CLI on Linux or WSL, you may encounter this error:
> 
> error: could not exec the linker cc = note: Permission denied (os error 13)

If you see this error message:

- Install the dependencies listed in the Linux section (WSL Properly).
- Retry installing the Anchor CLI.

### Installing Node.js and Yarn on Linux Setup
Install nvm using the following command:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
```
Restart your terminal and confirm that the nvm command runs successfully:
```bash
command -v nvm
```
Next, use nvm to install node:
```bash
nvm install node
```
To verify that the installation succeeded, check the Node version:
```bash
node --version
```
You should see output like the following: v23.7.0

> [!Warning]  
> The error indicates that the npm install command is encountering a permission issue

1.  Check Permissions of the node_modules Directory
- Run the following to check the ownership of the node_modules directory:
```bash
ls -ld node_modules
```
- If the directory is owned by another user or has restricted permissions, update the ownership to your user:
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) node_modules
```

2. Clear node_modules and Reinstall
- Sometimes, issues occur due to incomplete or corrupted installations. Remove the node_modules directory and reinstall dependencies:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
```
3. Avoid Using sudo with npm
- Using sudo with npm/pnpm can cause permission problems. Ensure that your npm/pnpm and Node.js setup doesn‚Äôt require elevated privileges.
- Reset the pnpm permissions:
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
```
4. Try Installing in a Clean Environment
- If the problem persists, try removing both the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json file, then reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
> Installation of pnpm over npm
- Install pnpm
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```
- Verify the installation:
```bash
pnpm --version
```
- Migrate Dependencies

Option A: Use pnpm import
- pnpm has a built-in command to migrate your existing package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json:
```bash
pnpm import
```
This command converts the lock file into pnpm-lock.yaml while keeping the dependencies consistent.

Option B: Remove node_modules and Reinstall
- Delete the existing node_modules directory and package-lock.json:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```
- Install dependencies using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm install
```
This will create a pnpm-lock.yaml and organize dependencies in a more efficient structure.

## Solana CLI Basics (Wallet Connect)
### Solana Config
```bash
solana config get
```

The RPC URL and Websocket URL specify the Solana cluster the CLI makes requests to.
```bash
solana config set --url mainnet-beta
```
```bash
solana config set --url devnet
```
```bash
solana config set --url localhost
```
```bash
solana config set --url testnet
```
The Keypair Path points to the default Solana wallet (keypair) used by the Solana CLI to pay transaction fees and deploy programs. By default, this file is stored at ~/.config/solana/id.json

### Create Wallet
- To send transactions using the Solana CLI, you need a Solana wallet funded with SOL.
```bash
solana-keygen new
```
- You should see output like the following:
```bash
Generating a new keypair

For added security, enter a BIP39 passphrase

NOTE! This passphrase improves security of the recovery seed phrase NOT the
keypair file itself, which is stored as insecure plain text

BIP39 Passphrase (empty for none):

Wrote new keypair to /Users/test/.config/solana/id.json
===========================================================================
pubkey: 8dBTPrjnkXyuQK3KDt9wrZBfizEZijmmUQXVHpFbVwGT
===========================================================================
Save this seed phrase and your BIP39 passphrase to recover your new keypair:
cream bleak tortoise ocean nasty game gift forget fancy salon mimic amazing
===========================================================================
```
- To view your wallet's address (public key), run:
```bash
solana address
```

### Airdrop SOL
Request an airdrop of SOL to your wallet to pay for transactions and program deployments.
- Set your cluster to the devnet:
```bash
solana config set -ud
```
- Then request an airdrop of devnet SOL:
```bash
solana airdrop 2
```
- To check your wallet's SOL balance, run the following command:
```bash
solana balance
```
